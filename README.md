# remark-containers

This [remark][remark] plugin provides parsing for containers so you can wrap blocks of markdown in arbitrary html containers. 

## Bugs

This is an initial version and is likely to have some bugs. If you find one, please [report it].

## Syntax

The first word after the `:::` is the container-type. **This is currently expected to be an html element name.** The rest of line is configuration and currently translates directly to the html element's class attribute. In the future I plan to make containers more configurable so you can specify whatever html you like for a specific container-type and map the configuration string in various ways.

```
::: aside optional list of classes
# Header One

With container contents. 
::: 
```
results in:

```
<aside class="optional list of classes">
<h1>Header One</h1>
<p>With container contents.</p>
</aside>
```
## Installation

[npm][npm]:

```bash
npm install remark-containers
```

const unified = require('unified')
